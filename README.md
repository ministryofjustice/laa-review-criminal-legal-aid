# laa-review-criminal-legal-aid

[![CI and CD](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-review-criminal-legal-aid/actions/workflows/test-build-deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-review-criminal-legal-aid/actions/workflows/test-build-deploy.yml)

A service to review criminal legal aid applications.  
This service is the case-worker side of [Apply for criminal legal aid](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-apply-for-criminal-legal-aid).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, and follow these steps in order.  
The instructions assume you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed in your machine, as well as use some ruby version manager, usually [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). If not, please install all this first.

**1. Pre-requirements**

- `brew bundle`
- `gem install bundler`
- `bundle install`

**2. Configuration**

- Copy `.env.development` to `.env.development.local` and modify with suitable values for your local machine
- Copy `.env.test` to `.env.test.local` and modify with suitable values for your local machine

After you've defined your DB configuration in the above files, run the following:

- `bin/rails db:prepare` (for the development database)
- `RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:prepare` (for the test database)

**3. GOV.UK Frontend (styles, javascript and other assets)**

- `yarn`

**4. Run the app locally**

Once all the above is done, you should be able to run the application as follows:

a) `bin/dev` - will run foreman, spawning a rails server, `yarn build` and `yarn build:css` to process JS and SCSS files and watch for any changes.  
b) `rails server` - will only run the rails server, usually fine if you are not making changes to the CSS.

You can also compile assets manually with `rails assets:precompile` at any time, and just run the rails server, without foreman.

If you ever feel something is not right with the CSS or JS, run `rails assets:clobber` to purge the local cache.

**5. Authenticating a user locally**

After clicking "Sign in," you will be shown a list of all users in the local database. Select one to sign in as that user.

To add users, select a user that can manage others and use the user management interface. A seed admin user is created by default (run `bundle exec rails db:seed` if none are listed). To ensure that the user's name is set correctly on first authorisation, use the format "<Firstname.Lastname@example.com>."

The last user in the list is "<Not.Authorised@example.com>." Select this user to simulate a non-authorised authenticated user.

This authentication strategy can be disabled locally by setting `DEV_AUTH_ENABLED=false`

**NOTE:** The dev_auth authentication strategy has been enabled for local development and docker compose by setting `DEV_AUTH_ENABLED=true` and `IS_LOCAL_DOCKER_ENV=true`.
This must never be enabled in the live (staging/production) service in it's current form as it will expose sensitive information.

## Local development with the temporary API gem

The app utilises [puma-dev](https://github.com/puma/puma-dev) for local development.

Follow the setup proceedure for puma-dev [outlined here](https://github.com/puma/puma-dev#install)

Clone [apply](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-apply-for-criminal-legal-aid), and the [laa-crime-apply-dev-api](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/laa-crime-apply-dev-api) locally.

Point the dev gem in apply's gemfile to your local laa-crime-apply-dev-api repo:

```
gem 'laa_crime_apply_dev_api', path: '../laa-crime-apply-dev-api'
```

Ensure that you have a `~/.puma-dev/` dir set up which contains symlinks to you local Apply and Review repos ([instructions](https://github.com/puma/puma-dev#usage))

You should now be able to access apply and review at the following convenience URLs:

```
http://laa-review-criminal-legal-aid.test/

http://laa-apply-for-criminal-legal-aid.test/

## Access dev api (as defined in the gem)
http://laa-apply-for-criminal-legal-aid.test/api/applications
http://laa-apply-for-criminal-legal-aid.test/api/applications/<application-id>
```

## Running the tests

You can run all the code linters and tests with:

- `rake`

The tasks run by default when using `rake`, are defined in the `Rakefile`.

Or you can run them individually:

- `rake spec`
- `rake erblint`
- `rake rubocop`
- `rake brakeman`

## Docker

The application can be run inside a docker container. This will take care of the ruby environment, postgres database
and any other dependency for you, without having to configure anything in your machine.

- `docker compose up`

The application will be run in "production" mode, so will be as accurate as possible to the real production environment.

**NOTE:** never use `docker compose` for a real production environment. This is only provided to test a local container. The
actual docker images used in the cluster are built as part of the deploy pipeline.

## Feature Flags

Feature flags can be set so that functionality can be enabled and disabled depending on the environment that the application is running in.

Set a new feature flag in the `config/settings.yml` under the heading `feature_flags` like so:

```yaml
# config/settings.yml
feature_flags:
  your_new_feature:
    local: true
    staging: true
    production: false
```

To check if a feature is enabled / disabled and run code accordingly, use:

```ruby
FeatureFlags.your_new_feature.enabled?
FeatureFlags.your_new_feature.disabled?
```

## Kubernetes deployment

### To provision infrastructure

AWS infrastructure is created by Cloud Platforms via PR to [their repository](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments).  
Read [how to connect the cluster](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/getting-started/kubectl-config.html).

**Namespaces for this service:**

- [staging namespace](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/tree/main/namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/laa-review-criminal-legal-aid-staging)
- [production namespace](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/tree/main/namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/laa-review-criminal-legal-aid-production)

### Applying the configuration

Configuration is applied automatically as part of each deploy. You can also apply configuration manually, for example:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/kubernetes/staging/ingress.yml
```

### Continuous integration and delivery

The application is setup to trigger tests on every pull request and, in addition, to build and release to staging
automatically on merge to `main` branch. Release to production will need to be approved manually.

All this is done through **github actions**.

The secrets needed for these actions are created automatically as part of the **terraforming**. You can read more about
it in [this document](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/deploying-an-app/github-actions-continuous-deployment.html#automating-the-deployment-process).

## Architectural decision records

ADRs are in the `./docs/architectural-decisions/` folder will hold markdown documents that record Architectural decision records (ARDs) for the LAA Review Criminal Legal Aid applications.

Please install [ADRs Tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) (`brew install adr-tools`) to help manage the creation of new ADR documents.

### To create a new ADR

After installing ADR tools use:

```
adr new <your ADR title>
```

This will initialise new blank ADR with your title as a heading and increment the ARD prefix to the correct number on the ARDs file name.

### Further info

For information on what ARDs are see [here](https://adr.github.io/).
